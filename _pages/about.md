Howdy! Welcome to my academic website. My name is Shengxiang (Joey) Wu, and I would like to document my academic progress here and share some scientific notes on my [Blog Posts](https://shengxiangwuplasmonic.github.io/year-archive/). I name this website "Plasmonics for Clean Energy" because I truly believe and hope my interested research area - 'plasmonic nanostructures' can provide clean energy for the world and help our planet fighting against climate change.

Plasmonic Nanostructures
======
*What is plasmon?* This is the question I asked the first day I entered the graduate school. Many papers introduce plasmons as the collective oscillation of electrons. Yet not entirely satisfied to this definition because two questions are still not answered: 1) why there is a resonance present when illuminating plasmonic nanostructures? 2) why people always refer to noble metals (e.g., gold, silver) when talking about plasmonic nanostructures?, let's accept this definition and restrict our attention to noble metals for the time being. Alternative introduction of plasmonic resonance (or more specificlly, the localized surface plasmon resonance) is available in [Blog Posts](https://shengxiangwuplasmonic.github.io/year-archive/).

The oscillaltion of free electrons is then attributed to the response of electrons (a negatively charged particle) to the alternating electric field of light (electromagnetic waves).
