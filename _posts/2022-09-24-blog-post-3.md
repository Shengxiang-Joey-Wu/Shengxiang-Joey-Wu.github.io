There was always a cyclic voltammetry (CV) running on the lab computer (remotely controlled by my collegues) everytime I passed by. I got really curious about the CV map, especially why there are two y (current) values corresponds to one x (potential) value. What's get me more curious is that my collegues can show to each other the CV map and talk science about it. I was too shy to ask how they do it (don't be like me), so I decided to figure it out myself, not only because I was curious but also I knew that if I want to perform photoelectrochemistry experiments on plasmonic nanoparticles someday, I got to know how the CV works and what it can tell me. So I write this blog to educate myself:
