In this paper, we descirbed a theoretical framework that connects the plasmon-induced nonthermal carriers to the photocatalytic reactions, e.g., the $\mathrm{O_2}$ dissociation. In specific, the nonthermal carriers are calculated similarly as in [ACS Photonics 2018, 5 (6), 2516-2523.](/publication/Wu-2018-ACS-Photonics), while the dissociation induced by electronic transition (electrons transfer back-and-forth from metal nanoparticles to adsorbates) is evaluated within the Newns-Anderson model.
