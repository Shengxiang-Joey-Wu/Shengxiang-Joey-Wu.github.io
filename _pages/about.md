Howdy! Welcome to my academic website. My name is Shengxiang (Joey) Wu, and I would like to document my academic progress here and share some scientific notes on my [Blog Posts](https://shengxiangwuplasmonic.github.io/year-archive/). I name this website "Plasmonics for Clean Energy" because I truly believe and hope my interested area - 'plasmonic nanostructures' can provide clean energy for the world and help our planet fighting against climate change..
