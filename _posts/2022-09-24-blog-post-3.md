There was always a cyclic voltammetry (CV) running on the lab computer (remotely controlled by my collegues) everytime I passed by. I got really curious about the CV map, especially why there are two $y$ (current) values corresponds to one $x$ (potential) value. What's get me more curious is that my collegues can show to each other the CV map and talk science about it. I was too shy to ask how they do it (don't be like me), so I decided to figure it out myself, not only because I was curious but also if I want to perform photoelectrochemistry experiments on plasmonic nanoparticles someday, I gotta know how the CV works and what it can tell me. So I write this blog to educate myself:

**chemical equilibrium**

For a simple chemical reaction

The equilibrium constant is defined as $K=\frac{[B]}{[A]}$, and once the equilibrium is reached the concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ do not change with time.

**kinetics**

At equilibrium, however, it does not mean that the reaction is 'frozen' - it is just because the forward reaction rate $v_f$ equals to the backward reaction rate $v_b$ so the concentration of reactants and products do not change with time. Assuming the forward and backward reactions are both first-order reactions, then the reaction rates and the equilibrium condition can be written as:

Both equilibrium constant (thermodynamic concept) and kinetics are important as the former tells us what equilibrium lools like and the later tells us how fast we can get there.

**activation energy and Arrhenius equation** 

In most cases, there is a 'hill' that reactant A needs to surpass before forming product B even the reaction is energy favorable $(\Delta_rG<0)$. If we c
