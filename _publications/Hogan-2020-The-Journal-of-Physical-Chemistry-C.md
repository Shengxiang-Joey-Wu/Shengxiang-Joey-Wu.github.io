This work is the cover art. In this paper, we provides a transparent physical model that predicts the steady-state temperature of a material (not necessarily be plasmonic nanostructure). The [anti-Stokes Raman thermometry](/publication/Wu-2019-ACS-Energy-Letters) was employed to extract the electronic temperature ( $T_e$) and population ( $\chi$) of hot electrons, which in turn gives the information of electron-phonon coupling at steady-state situation.
