In this paper, we proposed an optical power conversion scheme (plasmon-induced asymmetric electron tunneling across a metallic tunnel junction). The asymmetric conditions are originated from electric bias (shifting Fermi level), photothermal effect and nonthermal carrier generation. The photothermal effect and the generation of nonthermal carriers are coupled since it is the dissipation (electron-phonon scatteirng) of nonthermal carriers that eventually gives the photothermal heating. To disentangle these two effects, we assumed a temperature gradient that is maintained across the junction under steady-state illumination and used the home-made code to calculate the generation of plasmonic nonthermal carriers. Furthermore, we involved the full-wave electromagnetic simulation (FDTD method) for practical device simulation.
