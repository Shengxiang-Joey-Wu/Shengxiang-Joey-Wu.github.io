In this work, we update the [plasmonic Raman thermometry technique](/publication/Wu-2021-Journal-of-Applied-Physics) and conducted a dual-beam configuration experiment wherein a 532 nm laser and a 633 nm laser are employed to specifically excite the interband and intraband transitions in periodic gold nanostructures. The insight obtained from the plasmonic Raman thermometry enables us to extract different hot carrier dynamics, even at **steady state**.
