There was always a cyclic voltammetry (CV) running on the lab computer (remotely controlled by my collegues) everytime I passed by. I got really curious about the CV map, especially why there are two $y$ (current) values corresponds to one $x$ (potential) value. What's get me more curious is that my collegues can show to each other the CV map and talk science about it. I was too shy to ask how they do it (don't be like me), so I decided to figure it out myself, not only because I was curious but also if I want to perform photoelectrochemistry experiments on plasmonic nanoparticles someday, I gotta know how the CV works and what it can tell me. So I write this blog to educate myself:


Preliminary Knowledge
======

***
**chemical equilibrium**

For a simple chemical reaction

$$A\rightleftarrows B$$

The equilibrium constant is defined as $K=\frac{[B]}{[A]}$, and once the equilibrium is reached the concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ do not change with time.

**kinetics**

At equilibrium, however, it does not mean that the reaction is 'frozen' - it is just because the forward reaction rate $v_f$ equals to the backward reaction rate $v_b$ so the concentration of reactants and products do not change with time. Assuming the forward and backward reactions are both first-order reactions, then the reaction rates and the equilibrium condition can be written as:

$$v_f =k_f[A],\qquad v_b=k_b[B]$$

$$v_f=v_b\Rightarrow k_f[A]=k_b[B]\qquad\mathrm{equilibrium}$$

where the $k_f$ and $k_b$ are the rate constants of forward and backward reactions, respectively. Both equilibrium constant (thermodynamic concept) and kinetics are important as the former tells us what equilibrium lools like and the later tells us how fast we can get there.

**activation energy and the Arrhenius equation** 

In most cases, there is a 'hill' that reactant A needs to surpass before forming product B even the reaction is energetic favorable $(\Delta_rG<0)$. The peak of the 'hill' is usually represented by a transition state (TS) or activated complex, and we can therefore define activation energies for forward $(E_{a,f})$ and backward $(E_{a,b})$. reactions. This is the basic of transition state theory (Fig. 1).

[The Arrhenius equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation) states that the rate constant is related to the activation energy and absolute temperature through

$$k=Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$$

where $A$ is a pre-exponential factor, it contains everything that we don't know (lol) about rate constant and ideally it should be temperature-insensitive. One can imagine that the rate constant would be greater (reaction is faster) if activation energy is smaller (or temperature is higher) and other reaction parameters are kept the same.

**the Nernst equation**
The potential of a redox (Ox-Red) couple is characterized by the [Nernst equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation), which links the potential to the concentration of Ox and Red species. The Nernst equation in the general case is:

$$\mathrm{Ox}+n\mathrm{e^-}\rightleftarrows \mathrm{Red}$$

$$E=E^0+\frac{RT}{nF}\ln\frac{C_\mathrm{Ox}}{C_\mathrm{Red}}$$

where $C_\mathrm{Ox}$ and $C_\mathrm{Red}$ are the concentrationsa of Ox and Red species. The potential evaluated in Nernst equation is also a thermodynamics property, but it turns out also affecting the reaction rates through the transition state theory (Fig. 1): the ratio between Ox and Red species alters the relative position of Ox (A) and Red (B) in the potential energy surface, therefore, it also alters the activation energies felt by Ox and Red (will explained in detail below).

The above preliminary knowledge shall leave us on the same page and can be found in many undergraduate chemistry textbooks. In below, we started to derive the cyclic voltammetry, which is inspired by [*J. Chem. Educ.* 2018, 95, 2, 197–206](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00361), [*J. Chem. Educ.* 2015, 92, 9, 1490–1496](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225), and [Electrochemical methods: fundamentals and applications. John Wiley & Sons: 2022.](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Electrochemical+Methods%3A+Fundamentals+and+Applications%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471043720).

Electron Transfer Process (A General Description)
=====

Since the redox reactions involve electron transfer, it wouldn't hurt if we first study the electron transfer process in general (Fig. 2). The simplist scenario is the one electron transfer process that reduces $\mathrm{Ox_1}$ to its reductive form $\mathrm{Red_1}$.

$$\mathrm{Ox_1}+\mathrm{e^-}\rightarrow \mathrm{Red_1}$$

Imagine we are electrons, why sometimes we flow from A to B and sometimes from B to A? What is the driving force behind that? Well, simply put, we always want to flow to somewhere we feel more comfortable (low potential energy). This is universal regardlessly if it is a homogeneous electron transfer or heterogeneous electron transfer (Fig. 2): To reduce $\mathrm{Ox_1}$ to $\mathrm{Red_1}$, the electrons may be injected from another reducing agent $\mathrm{Red_2}$ where the electrons are more uncomfortable (high potential energy) or from electrode that is purposely maintained at high (negative) potential.

</p>

At this stage, it is important for us to go through this in mind: 1) electrons flow from high energy to low energy points, 2) for electrodes, positive potential tends to lower electron energy (electrons are more comfortable), thus prevents electrons flowing out from electrode, and *vice versa*.

Diffusion In An Electrochemical Cell
=====

Now we are ready to see what my collegues usually do in the lab: constructing an electrochemical (EC) cell and perform analysis such as CV. A representative EC cell (3 electrode configuration) is shown in Fig. 3. Basically, it contains three electrodes: the working electrode is the one we are primarily interested as it drives the targeted redox reactions (either the electrolyte or the electrode itself), the counter electrode is just for circuit connection purpose (it can extract or inject electrons to electrolyte solutions easily), and the reference electrode tells us what is the potential now of working electrode, that is, when reporting potential we usually write *vs. reference electrode*.

</p>

There is one key difference between an EC cell and an ordinary electric circuit: the current measured in an EC cell is dictated by the reaction rates of oxidation of Red (inject electrons to electrode) and reduction of Ox (extract electrons from electrode) occured on the electrode surface, while the current measured in an ordinary electric circuit is determined by the voltage drop and the resistance (Ohm's law). In an EC cell, therefore, the current depends on the reaction rates, which is further related to the concentrations of Ox and Red species and the potential provided by the working electrode (see below). What's important is that besides the reactions that consume or produce redox couples, both Ox and Red are suffered from diffusion in the EC cell (see inset in Fig. 3).

If, for simplicity, we treat the diffusion in one dimension only, that is, we assume both Ox and Red only diffuse perpendicular to the electrode surface and the electrode surface is perfectly smooth, then we can use the Fick's second law of diffusion (eq. 8) to describe diffusion of $\mathrm{Ox}$ and $\mathrm{Red}$ from and approach to surface.

$$\frac{\delta C}{\delta t}=D\frac{\delta^2 C}{\delta x^2}$$

where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.
