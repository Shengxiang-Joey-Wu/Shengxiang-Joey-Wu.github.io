Howdy! Welcome to my academic website. My name is Shengxiang (Joey) Wu, and I would like to document my academic progress here and share some scientific notes on my [Blog Posts](https://shengxiangwuplasmonic.github.io/year-archive/). I name this website "Plasmonics for Clean Energy" because I truly believe and hope my interested research area - 'plasmonic nanostructures' can provide clean energy for the world and help our planet fighting against climate change.

Plasmonic Nanostructures
======
*What is plasmon?* This is the question I asked the first day I entered the graduate school. Many papers introduce plasmons as **the collective oscillation of electrons**. Yet not entirely satisfied to this definition because two questions are still not answered: 1) why there is a resonance present when illuminating plasmonic nanostructures? 2) why people always refer to noble metals (e.g., gold, silver) when talking about plasmonic nanostructures?, let's accept this definition and restrict our attention to noble metals for the time being. Alternative introduction to plasmonic nanoparticles and the answers to the two questions can be found in [Phys Rev Lett 2005, 95 (9), 095504.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.095504).

Following the naive rationale, the oscillaltion of free electrons is simply due to the response of electrons (a negatively charged particle) to the alternating electric field of light (electromagnetic waves). This oscillation is usually occured at the metal/dielectric interface and if it is restricted to a nanostructure with well-defined shape, the localized surface plasmon (LSP) emerges. And we termed nanoparticles that support LSP the plasmonic nanostructures. 

Note: There is another type of plasmon, the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) that can propagate along the surface, which is important in nanophotonic applications such as waveguides. 

Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)
=====
If one illuminates a plasmonic nanosphere with varied wavelengths, one may found a peak in the absorption or scattering spectrum, which indicates a resonance (LSPR). The wavelength/frequency that this peak occurs is termed the surface plasmon resonance frequency. Now you can imagine why I am not satisfied with *plasmons are the collective oscillations of electrons*: oscillations do not necessarily yield a resonance. This insatisfactory is resolved if we view the plasmonic nanoparticle with its dielectric environment as [a nanoscaled LC-circuit](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.095504), then the LSPR emerges naturally and simiarily as the LC-resonance. With this in mind, we can imagine that the electrons oscillates stronger at plasmon resonance and weaker if out of resonance.
