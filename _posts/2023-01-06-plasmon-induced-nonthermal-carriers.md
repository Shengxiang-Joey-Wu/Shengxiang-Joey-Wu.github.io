In the previous [blog](https://shengxiangwuplasmonic.github.io/posts/2022/09/what-is-plasmonic-nanostructure/), I mentioned that the non-radiative damping of surface plasmon was historically viewed as losses in the field of nanophotonics,<sup>1</sup> however, it is now a popular topic in the community of photocatalysis and photochemistry community since people realized that the 'losses', if managed properly, can be turned into advantages to drive (uphill) chemical reactions and even demonstrate certain bond selectivity that is not accessible by thermal means. 

The advantages are associated with energetic nonthermal or hot carriers that are generated after the non-radiative damping of surface plasmons, therefore it would be nice if one can predict the energy distribution of nonthermal carriers for given plasmonic nanoparticles. Indeed, there are multiple ways to perform such a calculation from free-electron-like algorithms<sup>2, 3</sup> to more rigorous treatments based on density functional theory (DFT).<sup>4, 5</sup> 

During my Ph.D. study and postdoctoral work, I have followed [ref. 2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/nn502445f) to calculate the energy profile of nonthermal carriers and then apply it to model the tunneling current<sup>6</sup> and photocatalytic performance.<sup>7</sup> It turns out that the approach used here could also be used as an extracurricular activity for first-year graduate students or senior undergraduates to strengthen the understanding of quantum chemistry. That being said, the replication of the major result of ref. 2 can be performed by combining the basic ideas of quantum chemistry and entry level of electromagnetics. Let's get started!
